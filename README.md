# StormBreaker

This is a python based hacking tool. This can be used to Hack into Wireless networks using Handshake capture.

## Working
- This tools first scans for all the available networks around the region
- Select the network you want to attack
- It tries to De-Authenticate the connected users, from the network by sending Deauth packets recursively
- After deauthenticating users device tries to connect to the Router automatically, at that time it caputures the 4-way handshake
- After handshake is capture it cracks the handshake using a wordlist.
